# Inspired Notes

Notes for the book "Inspired" by Marty Cagan.

https://www.amazon.com/INSPIRED-Create-Tech-Products-Customers/dp/1119387507

## Preface

+ There is no formula for product success, you have to learn the techniques and experiment

## CH 1

+ Product is hard and time-consuming
+ This book assumes you have a team of product, design, and engineering

## CH 2

+ This book focuses on tech-powered Products

## CH 3

+ There are 3 kinds of tech companies:
  + Startups
  + Growth-stage companies
  + Enterprise companies
+ Startups are a race to "product-market fit"
+ Fast pace, but little bureaucracy, lots of experimentation

> "Nothing else much matters until you can come up with a strong product that meets the needs of an initial market"

## CH 4

+ Growth-stage companies have found "product-market fit" and are struggling to scale
+ Strategies need to be adapted from all departments
+ Product teams need to understand how the fit into the big picture
+ Technical debt becomes a big deal

## CH 5

+ Enterprise companies have achieved the original vision of the company
+ Good enterprise companies need continuous innovation, otherwise slow death spiral (continuous improvement)
+ Difficult to innovate because people want to protect the initial success
+ Product complains about design by committee, leadership complains about lack of innovation

## CH 6

+ Ideas can't come from execs/owners/stakeholders/customers
+ At least 50% of ideas won't work
+ Ideas that do work take several iterations
+ Product/Design/Eng needs to be involved from the beginning
+ Waste as little time/$ as possible figuring out if an idea works

## CH 7

+ Tackle risks before building:
  + Will it sell?
  + Is it easy to use?
  + Can we build it?
  + Does it work for the rest of the business?
+ Design products collaboratively with the *whole* team
+ Solve problems instead of implementing features

## CH 8
+ A "Product" includes everything: features, technology, marketing, UX, monetization, etc.
+ Two high-level objectives: discover what to build, and build it.  Those happen *continuously*
+ The objective of product discovery is to reduce the risks from ch. 7
+ Treat prototypes like CI/CD -- as many and as fast as possible

> "So, we use *prototypes* to conduct rapid experiments ... release *products* in hopes of achieving *product/market fit* ... to deliver on the company's *product vision*"

+ An MVP should be a *prototype*! (used for discovery and not long-term sustainable)

## Part II Intro

> "This is probably the most important concept in this entire book: It's all about the product team."

## CH 9

+ Try to minimize dependencies between teams
+ Product and eng leadership work together to make teams
+ Teams are given problems and the autonomy to go and solve them
+ Team dynamic is important, sit next to each other, develop relationships
+ Teams need to stay together to develop relationships and expertise and be invested in their problems
+ Collaboration is #1, and collaboration is built on relationships
+ Team needs to understand business objectives and be accountable for them

## CH 10

+ Product manager is responsible for the success of a product

> "What's hard is to make sure that what goes on the product backlog is worth building"

+ Feature parity is not enough, you need to have a much better product for people to switch
+ Product manager must have deep knowledge of:
  + The customer
  + "The data" (analytics, usage, sales numbers, etc)
  + The business & stakeholders
  + The market/industry
+ Needs for subject-matter experts are fairly rare
+ The best solutions don't come from users/customers/sales

## CH 11

+ Continuous collaboration
+ Good design is one of the best "competitive differentiators"
+ We need design to discover the right product
+ Design informs function as much as function informs design
+ He notes 3 scenarios that are "serious problems" but doesn't say why they are
+ Whole team solves the problem together, including design

## CH 12

+ Everything in this chapter is great
